# Notice of Decommission

---
I have decided to put Logan offline, permanently. This is because I really only made him to learn how his libraries work, and now I know so much, that I feel I could make something so much better. I never had any ideas for him in the long run, and the ones I did have were unoriginal and lacked good performance. I will not be deleting him of course, just putting him offline, as I tend to forget things and need to look back at previous code samples I wrote. I have a few ideas for new, original bots, and Logans (heavily under-development) website can easily be changed to accomodate for the new bot I decide to make.
