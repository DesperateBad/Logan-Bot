### Setup Instructions:
1. Invite the bot to your server.
2. Make sure the bot has permission to send messages in **at least one** text channel.
3. In a text channel the bot can send messages to, use the command `?setconf edit modRole <role name>`, replacing `<role name>` with the name of a role that has moderator permissions.
4. Use the command `?setconf edit adminRole <role name>`, replacing `<role name>` with the name of a role that has administrator permissions.
