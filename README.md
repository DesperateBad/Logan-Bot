### Setup Instructions:
1. Invite the bot to your server.
2. Make sure the bot has permission to send messages in **at least one** text channel.
3. Use the command `?conf edit adminRole <role name>`, replacing `<role name>` with the name of a role that has administrator permissions. Only members with this role will be able to run the `?conf` command, and other commands.

**Loganis all set up on your server now! Use ?help to view commands that your permission level can use! (You can use `?level` to check your permission level)**
